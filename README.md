# HomeAssistant - Tapo: Cameras Control

Custom component - Tapo: Cameras Control - to add Tapo cameras into Home Assistant

## Installation

Copy contents of custom_components/tapo_control/ to custom_components/tapo_control/ in your Home Assistant config folder.

## Installation using HACS

HACS is a community store for Home Assistant. You can install [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) and then install Tapo: Camera Control from the HACS store.

## Requirements

### Network

Following target TCP ports **must be open** in firewall for the camera to access your Tapo Camera from Home Assistant:

- 443 - HTTPS for control of the camera ([services](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/HomeAssistant-Tapo-Control#services))
- 554 - RTSP to fetch video stream from the camera
- 2020 - ONVIF to track detected movement via a binary sensor

## Usage

Add cameras via Integrations (search for Tapo) in Home Assistant UI.

Cameras are also automatically discovered when they are (re)connected to WIFI.

To add multiple cameras, add integration multiple times.

See [examples for lovelace cards](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/HomeAssistant-Tapo-Control/blob/main/examples/EXAMPLES_LOVELACE.md) or [examples for template entities](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/HomeAssistant-Tapo-Control/blob/main/examples/EXAMPLES_ENTITIES.md).

## Services

This custom component creates:

- tapo_control.\* services to control a camera
- 2 camera entities, one for HD and one for SD stream
- 1 binary sensor for motion after the motion is detected for the first time

Use these services in following service calls.

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.ptz</summary>

Pan and tilt camera.

You are also able to use presets and set distance the ptz should travel.

- **tilt** Optional: Tilt direction. Allowed values: UP, DOWN
- **pan** Optional: Pan direction. Allowed values: RIGHT, LEFT
- **preset** Optional: PTZ preset ID or a Name. See possible presets in entity attributes.
- **distance** Optional: Distance coefficient. Sets how much PTZ should be executed in one request. Allowed values: floating point numbers, 0 to 1
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.set_privacy_mode</summary>

Sets privacy mode.

If privacy mode is turned on, camera does not record anything and does not respond to anything other than turning off privacy mode.

- **privacy_mode** Required: Sets privacy mode for camera. Possible values: on, off
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.set_alarm_mode</summary>

Sets alarm mode.

If camera detects motion, it will sound an alarm, blink the LED or both.

- **alarm_mode** Required: Sets alarm mode for camera. Possible values: on, off
- **sound** Optional: Sets whether the alarm should use sound on motion detected. Possible values: on, off
- **light** Optional: Sets whether the alarm should use light on motion detected. Possible values: on, off
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.set_led_mode</summary>

Sets LED mode.

When on, LED is turned on when camera is on.

When off, LED is always off.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.format</summary>

Formats SD card of a camera

</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.set_motion_detection_mode</summary>

Sets motion detection mode.

Ability to set "high", "normal" or "low".

These turn on motion detection and set sensitivity to corresponding values in the app.

Also ability to set to "off", this turns off motion detection completely.

Turning motion detection off does not affect settings for recordings so you do not need to re-set those unless you open the settings through the Tapo app.

Notice: If you use motion detection triggered recording and you turn off motion recording, it will no longer record!

- **motion_detection_mode** Required: Sets motion detection mode for camera. Possible values: high, normal, low, off
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.set_auto_track_mode</summary>

**Warning: This mode is not available in Tapo app and we do not know why. Use at your own risk and please report any success or failures in [Home Assistant: Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tapo-cameras-control/231795).**

Sets auto track mode.

With this mode, camera will be adjusting ptz to track whatever moving object it sees.

Motion detection setting does not affect this mode.

- **auto_track_mode** Required: Sets auto track mode for camera. Possible values: on, off
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.reboot</summary>

Reboots the camera

</details>

<details>
  <summary>tapo_control.save_preset</summary>

</details>

## Sound Detection

Integration is capable of analysing sound from camera microphone and expose a new attribute noise_detected on cameras when a voice threshold is reached.

You need to enable this feature in integration options by checking "Enable sound threshold detection". After enabling it, you can also set any other options starting with [Sound Detection]. You will need to restart Home Asssistant after doing any changes.

For more information and troubleshooting see [Home Assistant ffmpeg documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ffmpeg_noise/) on which this feature is based on.

## Troubleshooting | FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Binary sensor for motion doesn't show up or work</summary>

Motion sensor is added only after a motion is detected for the first time.

- Make sure the camera has motion detection turned on
- Make sure the camera has privacy mode turned off
- Make sure the camera can see you and your movement
- Try walking in front of the camera
- If above didn't work, restart the camera and try again

Also make sure that:

- binary sensor is not disabled via entity, check .storage/core.entity_registry for disabled entities, look for "disabled_by": "user" on platform "tapo_control". If it is, remove the whole entity or change to "disabled_by": null, and restart HASS.
- binary sensor is enabled in tapo integration options
- onvif port 2020 on camera is opened

<details>
  <summary>Big delay in camera stream</summary>

This is a [known issue](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/i-tried-all-the-camera-platforms-so-you-dont-have-to/222999) of Home Assistant.

There is an ability to disable usage of Home Assistant Stream component for the camera, which might lower the delay very significantly at cost of higher CPU usage.

You can choose to disable stream component when adding the camera, or via Options when camera has already been added. This change requires a restart of Home Assistant.

There might be some disadvantages to doing this, like losing option to control playback and a higher CPU usage.
Results depend on your hardware and future Home Assistant updates.

If you disable stream and your hardware is not up to the task, you will get artifacts, bigger delay and freezes.

If you wish, try it out and see what works best for you.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>No audio in camera stream</summary>

Supported audio codecs in Home Assistant are "aac", "ac3" and "mp3".

Tapo Cameras use PCM ALAW (alaw) which is not supported.

[More details here.](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/HomeAssistant-Tapo-Control/issues/58#issuecomment-762787442)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Supported models</summary>

Users reported full functionality with following Tapo Cameras:

- TC60
- C100
- C200
- C310

The integration _should_ work with any other Tapo Cameras.

If you had success with some other model, please report it via a new issue.
